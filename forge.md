# Reasons why we won't port FoxClient to Forge
 - Forge makes developing certain features harder ~~(no mixins)~~ update: i found out forge does have mixins
 - Forge is not optimal for client-side mods
 - Fabric and Quilt have better performance than Forge from my experience

**However, there is nothing stopping you from doing it yourself by forking the project,**
**but please do not call it an official port. Make it clear it is unsupported by us.**


## UNSUPPORTED

**It is possible to run FoxClient on Forge/NeoForge\* with [Sinytra Connector](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector) and [Forgified Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/forgified-fabric-api)**

**For ModMenu support, you can also drop the corresponding ModMenu jar into your mods folder**
